## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

During this project, I acquired several valuable insights and skills:

- **Mobile-first Workflow:**
  - Embracing a mobile-first workflow proved more intriguing compared to a desktop-first approach. It reduces repetition because the starting point closely aligns with the mobile design, necessitating minimal styling adjustments.

- **box-sizing:**
  - Implementing box-sizing: border-box; proved transformative as it prevents elements from expanding when padding and margin are added, significantly enhancing layout control.

```css
*{
    margin: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

- **cursor:**
  - Employing cursor: pointer; for interactive elements enhanced user experience and navigation intuitiveness.
